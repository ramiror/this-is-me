> *Yeah all the green things died*<br/>
> *When Ronnie moved to this place*<br/>
> *He said, donâ€™t you dare ask*<br/>
> *Why I'm cursed to wear this face*<br/>
> *Now we all know why*<br/>
> *The children called him Ronnie Frown*<br/>
> *When he pulled that gun from his pocket*<br/>
> *And they'd all fall down, bang! bang!*<br/>
